# bloop `v2.0.17`

## Analysis hash in the compilation result

Bloop v2.0.17 introduces a new report field to the compilation result to allow
clients to track the analysis hash of the last successful compilation.

This is represented in the data field of the `CompileResult` result message as a
map of project URIs to the hashes of the analyses of the projects. The
`ScalaCompileReport` message is defined as follows:

```
case class ScalaCompileReport(
      errors: Int,
      warnings: Int,
      isCompilationNoop: Boolean,
      compilationHashes: Map[String, Int]
)
```

## New `--show-rendered-message` ccompilation options

If any Bloop client needs to see the rendered message of the compilation instead
of the raw message, it can now pass the `--show-rendered-message` option to the
`compile` command. This can be especially useful for command line clients that
want to see the compilation messages in a more human-readable format.

## Bugfixes

- fixed an issue with downloading compiler bridge sources in fallback mode, when
  credentials were needed for a custom repository.
- use the default CompileReport in compilation task finished notification
  instead of a custom one
- check modification time with millisecond precision when noop compilation is
  detected to track if files need to be copied. Previously, they would always be
  checked even if the modification time was the same.
- don't use absolute path which might be longer than the limit for the limit of
  the path length when not needed for bsp sockets
