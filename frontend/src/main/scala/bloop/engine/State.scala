/**
 * Represents the state for a given build.

 * An state is aggressively cached by bloop so that operations that target a build can reuse
 * the state that has already been created before. The state is immutable and allows different
 * builds to change common values utilized by all the bloop operations.
 *
 * @param build The build with which the state is associated.
 * @param results The results cache that contains all the analysis file for a build.
 * @param compilerCache The cache that has pointers to hot compilers (shared across other states).
 * @param commonOptions The environment options necessary for input and output.
 * @param status The status in which the state is currently.
 * @param logger The logger that is used and is associated with a given build.
