       *       * New client directories for a project are created in the file system

       *         `uniqueDirs`.
       *       * A new client connects right after we obtain current clients and
       *         starts creating new client directories in projects, which would be
       *         incorrectly removed by our logic if we didn't check the clients we
       *         obtained initially and those that exist after listing all client
       *         directories is the same. When it's not the same, we retry the task
       *         again up to a limit of 5 times. If the fifth attempt doesn't work, we
       *         give up and let the cleanup for a moment where there is less
       *         connection activity in the server.
       *
       * We also protect ourselves from typical IO exceptions in case the file
       * system doesn't allow the bloop server to run operations on these
       * directories. This could happen if for example these directories are
       * owned by another user than the one running the bloop server.
