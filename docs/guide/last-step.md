This is it! You already have Bloop and the Bloop CLI installed in your
machine. Now, it's time to write Scala code and be productive.

You can either use an IDE such as [Metals](docs/ides/metals) or
[IntelliJ](docs/ides/intellij) to write code or play with the
[CLI](docs/cli/tutorial) if you want to explore what CLI options are
available.

If you need help, you can always come over our [Discord
channel](hhttps://discord.gg/KWF9zMhJWS).
