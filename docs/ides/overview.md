IDEs can use bloop to compile, test and run Scala code fast via the
[Build Server Protocol (BSP)](https://github.com/scalacenter/bsp). The protocol
allows clients to establish a long-lived build session to, for example, receive
accurate compilation diagnostics in text editors and IDEs.

There are two main IDE integrations:

1. [IntelliJ](ides/intellij.md), the most popular Scala and Java IDE.
1. [Metals](ides/metals.md), a Scala language server that
   supports text editors such as Visual Studio Code, `vim`, Sublime Text and
   Atom.

These IDE integrations support the following BSP actions:

|                  | Build import | Compile | Test | Run | Debug |
